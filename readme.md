##gSchool Group Project: Roulette
<br>
This repo consists of individual and pair contributions to our first gSchool group project. This project is based off of the instruction to create a class casino where each group works on coding a game to contribute to the g11 Casino. Our contribution is a simplified version of Roulette, which we hope to continue to build on.
